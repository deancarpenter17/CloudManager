Python program that automatically creates an Amazon EC2 VM. Once a VM is created, it emails the user the public IP/DNS and other instance details, along with an SSH script and the .pem key-file. This allows the user to quickly SSH into the server and removes a lot of the steps involved when creating a VM. 

This project is still in the works, I'm currently creating an iOS frontend so you can manage the VM's you have from your phone. I'm also making the code more generic to allow for more options when creating VMs.
